### Hi there 👋

🧔🏻‍♂️ I'm Eugene Oskin, a CTO of Termius.

🔭 I’m currently working on making Termius a great startup.

🌱 I’m currently learning tensorflow, natural language processing, Rust, and Tauri.

💬 Ask me about Software Architecture, Information Security, Django, Python, TypeScript, React, Electron, NodeJS, Swift on iOS, Android, Arduino, IaS, AWS, Video Streaming, Technical leadership, awareness, and project management. Also, I like to talk about other programming languages like Elixir, Rust, Go, Scala, Haskell.

🤔 I’m looking for help with building a network similar to OpenAI Codex.

⚡ Fun fact: I worked in Termius way before it became a startup. It was a Consulting business and I worked as a software engineer and architect for several.
